Evaluate BODY with VAR bound to each `car' from LIST, in turn.
Then evaluate RESULT to get return value, default nil.
An implicit nil block is established around the loop.

At each iteration MESSAGE followed by progress percentage is
printed in the echo area.  After the loop is finished, MESSAGE
followed by word \"done\" is printed.  This macro is a
convenience wrapper around `make-progress-reporter' and friends.
